    <h2 id="introducing-the-shell"><a href="">Introducing the Shell</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>A shell is a program whose primary purpose is to read commands and run other programs.</li>
  <li>The shell’s main advantages are its high action-to-keystroke ratio,
its support for automating repetitive tasks,
and that it can be used to access networked machines.</li>
  <li>The shell’s main disadvantages are its primarily textual nature
and how cryptic its commands and operation can be.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="files-and-directories"><a href="">Files and Directories</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>The file system is responsible for managing information on the disk.</li>
  <li>Information is stored in files, which are stored in directories (folders).</li>
  <li>Directories can also store other directories, which forms a directory tree.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">cd path</code> changes the current working directory.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">ls path</code> prints a listing of a specific file or directory;
<code class="highlighter-rouge">ls</code> on its own lists the current working directory.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> prints the user’s current working directory.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">whoami</code> shows the user’s current identity.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">/</code> on its own is the root directory of the whole file system.</li>
  <li>A relative path specifies a location starting from the current location.</li>
  <li>An absolute path specifies a location from the root of the file system.</li>
  <li>Directory names in a path are separated with ‘/’ on Unix, but ‘\’ on Windows.</li>
  <li>’..’ means “the directory above the current one”;
‘.’ on its own means “the current directory”.</li>
  <li>Most files’ names are <code class="highlighter-rouge">something.extension</code>.
The extension isn’t required,
and doesn’t guarantee anything,
but is normally used to indicate the type of data in the file.</li>
  <li>Most commands take options (flags) which begin with a ‘-‘.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="creating-things"><a href="">Creating Things</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">cp old new</code> copies a file.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">mkdir path</code> creates a new directory.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">mv old new</code> moves (renames) a file or directory.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">rm path</code> removes (deletes) a file.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">rmdir path</code> removes (deletes) an empty directory.</li>
  <li>Unix documentation uses ‘^A’ to mean “control-A”.</li>
  <li>The shell does not have a trash bin: once something is deleted, it’s really gone.</li>
  <li>Nano is a very simple text editor — please use something else for real work.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pipes-and-filters"><a href="">Pipes and Filters</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">cat</code> displays the contents of its inputs.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">head</code> displays the first few lines of its input.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">tail</code> displays the last few lines of its input.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">sort</code> sorts its inputs.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">wc</code> counts lines, words, and characters in its inputs.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">command &gt; file</code> redirects a command’s output to a file.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">first | second</code> is a pipeline: the output of the first command is used as the input to the second.</li>
  <li>The best way to use the shell is to use pipes to combine simple single-purpose programs (filters).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="loops"><a href="">Loops</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>A <code class="highlighter-rouge">for</code> loop repeats commands once for every thing in a list.</li>
  <li>Every <code class="highlighter-rouge">for</code> loop needs a variable to refer to the current “thing”.</li>
  <li>Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">$name</code> to expand a variable (i.e., get its value).</li>
  <li>Do not use spaces, quotes, or wildcard characters such as ‘*’ or ‘?’ in filenames, as it complicates variable expansion.</li>
  <li>Give files consistent names that are easy to match with wildcard patterns to make it easy to select them for looping.</li>
  <li>Use the up-arrow key to scroll up through previous commands to edit and repeat them.</li>
  <li>Use “control-r” to search through the previously entered commands.</li>
  <li>Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">history</code> to display recent commands, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">!number</code> to repeat a command by number.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="shell-scripts"><a href="">Shell Scripts</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>Save commands in files (usually called shell scripts) for re-use.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">bash filename</code> runs the commands saved in a file.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">$*</code> refers to all of a shell script’s command-line parameters.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">$1</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">$2</code>, etc., refer to specified command-line parameters.</li>
  <li>Place variables in quotes if the values might have spaces in them.</li>
  <li>Letting users decide what files to process is more flexible and more consistent with built-in Unix commands.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="finding-things"><a href="">Finding Things</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">find</code> finds files with specific properties that match patterns.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">grep</code> selects lines in files that match patterns.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">man command</code> displays the manual page for a given command.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code> matches zero or more characters in a filename, so <code class="highlighter-rouge">*.txt</code> matches all files ending in <code class="highlighter-rouge">.txt</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">?</code> matches any single character in a filename, so <code class="highlighter-rouge">?.txt</code> matches <code class="highlighter-rouge">a.txt</code> but not <code class="highlighter-rouge">any.txt</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">$(command)</code> inserts a command’s output in place.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">man command</code> displays the manual page for a given command.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="glossary">Glossary</h2>

<h4 id="absolute-path">absolute path</h4>
<p>:   A <a href="#path">path</a> that refers to a particular location in a file system.
    Absolute paths are usually written with respect to the file system’s
    <a href="#root-directory">root directory</a>,
    and begin with either “/” (on Unix) or “\” (on Microsoft Windows).
    See also: <a href="#relative-path">relative path</a>.</p>

<h4 id="argument">argument</h4>
<p>:   A value given to a function or program when it runs.
    The term is often used interchangeably (and inconsistently) with <a href="#parameter">parameter</a>.</p>

<h4 id="command-shell">command shell</h4>
<p>:   See <a href="#shell">shell</a></p>

<h4 id="command-line-interface">command-line interface</h4>
<p>:   An interface based on typing commands,
    usually at a <a href="#read-evaluate-print-loop">REPL</a>.
    See also: <a href="#graphical-user-interface">graphical user interface</a>.</p>

<h4 id="comment">comment</h4>
<p>:   A remark in a program that is intended to help human readers understand what is going on,
    but is ignored by the computer.
    Comments in Python, R, and the Unix shell start with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">#</code> character and run to the end of the line;
    comments in SQL start with <code class="highlighter-rouge">--</code>,
    and other languages have other conventions.</p>

<h4 id="current-working-directory">current working directory</h4>
<p>:   The directory that <a href="#relative-path">relative paths</a> are calculated from;
    equivalently,
    the place where files referenced by name only are searched for.
    Every <a href="#process">process</a> has a current working directory.
    The current working directory is usually referred to using the shorthand notation <code class="highlighter-rouge">.</code> (pronounced “dot”).</p>

<h4 id="file-system">file system</h4>
<p>:   A set of files, directories, and I/O devices (such as keyboards and screens).
    A file system may be spread across many physical devices,
    or many file systems may be stored on a single physical device;
    the <a href="#operating-system">operating system</a> manages access.</p>

<h4 id="filename-extension">filename extension</h4>
<p>:   The portion of a file’s name that comes after the final “.” character.
    By convention this identifies the file’s type:
    <code class="highlighter-rouge">.txt</code> means “text file”, <code class="highlighter-rouge">.png</code> means “Portable Network Graphics file”,
    and so on. These conventions are not enforced by most operating systems:
    it is perfectly possible to name an MP3 sound file <code class="highlighter-rouge">homepage.html</code>.
    Since many applications use filename extensions to identify the <a href="#mime-type">MIME type</a> of the file,
    misnaming files may cause those applications to fail.</p>

<h4 id="filter">filter</h4>
<p>:   A program that transforms a stream of data.
    Many Unix command-line tools are written as filters:
    they read data from <a href="#standard-input">standard input</a>,
    process it, and write the result to <a href="#standard-output">standard output</a>.</p>

<h4 id="flag">flag</h4>
<p>:   A terse way to specify an option or setting to a command-line program.
    By convention Unix applications use a dash followed by a single letter,
    such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">-v</code>, or two dashes followed by a word, such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">--verbose</code>,
    while DOS applications use a slash, such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">/V</code>.
    Depending on the application, a flag may be followed by a single argument, as in <code class="highlighter-rouge">-o /tmp/output.txt</code>.</p>

<h4 id="for-loop">for loop</h4>
<p>:   A loop that is executed once for each value in some kind of set, list, or range.
    See also: <a href="#while-loop">while loop</a>.</p>

<h4 id="graphical-user-interface">graphical user interface</h4>
<p>:   A graphical user interface,
    usually controlled by using a mouse.
    See also: <a href="#command-line-interface">command-line interface</a>.</p>

<h4 id="home-directory">home directory</h4>
<p>:   The default directory associated with an account on a computer system.
    By convention, all of a user’s files are stored in or below her home directory.</p>

<h4 id="loop">loop</h4>
<p>:   A set of instructions to be executed multiple times. Consists of a <a href="#loop-body">loop body</a> and (usually) a
    condition for exiting the loop. See also <a href="#for-loop">for loop</a> and <a href="#while-loop">while loop</a>.</p>

<h4 id="loop-body">loop body</h4>
<p>:   The set of statements or commands that are repeated inside a <a href="#for-loop">for loop</a>
    or <a href="#while-loop">while loop</a>.</p>

<h4 id="mime-type">MIME type</h4>
<p>:   MIME (Multi-Purpose Internet Mail Extensions) types describe different file types for exchange on the Internet,
    for example images, audio, and documents.</p>

<h4 id="operating-system">operating system</h4>
<p>:   Software that manages interactions between users, hardware, and software <a href="#process">processes</a>. Common
    examples are Linux, OS X, and Windows.</p>

<h4 id="orthogonal">orthogonal</h4>
<p>:   To have meanings or behaviors that are independent of each other.
    If a set of concepts or tools are orthogonal,
    they can be combined in any way.</p>

<h4 id="parameter">parameter</h4>
<p>:   A variable named in the function’s declaration that is used to hold a value passed into the call.
    The term is often used interchangeably (and inconsistently) with <a href="#argument">argument</a>.</p>

<h4 id="parent-directory">parent directory</h4>
<p>:   The directory that “contains” the one in question.
    Every directory in a file system except the <a href="#root-directory">root directory</a> has a parent.
    A directory’s parent is usually referred to using the shorthand notation <code class="highlighter-rouge">..</code> (pronounced “dot dot”).</p>

<h4 id="path">path</h4>
<p>:   A description that specifies the location of a file or directory within a <a href="#file-system">file system</a>.
    See also: <a href="#absolute-path">absolute path</a>, <a href="#relative-path">relative path</a>.</p>

<h4 id="pipe">pipe</h4>
<p>:   A connection from the output of one program to the input of another.
    When two or more programs are connected in this way, they are called a “pipeline”.</p>

<h4 id="process">process</h4>
<p>:   A running instance of a program, containing code, variable values,
    open files and network connections, and so on.
    Processes are the “actors” that the <a href="#operating-system">operating system</a> manages;
    it typically runs each process for a few milliseconds at a time
    to give the impression that they are executing simultaneously.</p>

<h4 id="prompt">prompt</h4>
<p>:   A character or characters display by a <a href="#read-evaluate-print-loop">REPL</a> to show that
    it is waiting for its next command.</p>

<h4 id="quoting">quoting</h4>
<p>:   (in the shell):
    Using quotation marks of various kinds to prevent the shell from interpreting special characters.
    For example, to pass the string <code class="highlighter-rouge">*.txt</code> to a program,
    it is usually necessary to write it as <code class="highlighter-rouge">'*.txt'</code> (with single quotes)
    so that the shell will not try to expand the <code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code> wildcard.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>read-evaluate-print loop</dt>
  <dd>(REPL): A <a href="#command-line-interface">command-line interface</a> that reads a command from the user,
executes it, prints the result, and waits for another command.</dd>
</dl>

<h4 id="redirect">redirect</h4>
<p>:   To send a command’s output to a file rather than to the screen or another command,
    or equivalently to read a command’s input from a file.</p>

<h4 id="regular-expression">regular expression</h4>
<p>:   A pattern that specifies a set of character strings.
    REs are most often used to find sequences of characters in strings.</p>

<h4 id="relative-path">relative path</h4>
<p>:   A <a href="#path">path</a> that specifies the location of a file or directory
    with respect to the <a href="#current-working-directory">current working directory</a>.
    Any path that does not begin with a separator character (“/” or “\”) is a relative path.
    See also: <a href="#absolute-path">absolute path</a>.</p>

<h4 id="root-directory">root directory</h4>
<p>:   The top-most directory in a <a href="#file-system">file system</a>.
    Its name is “/” on Unix (including Linux and Mac OS X) and “\” on Microsoft Windows.</p>

<h4 id="shell">shell</h4>
<p>:   A <a href="#cli">command-line interface</a> such as Bash (the Bourne-Again Shell)
    or the Microsoft Windows DOS shell
    that allows a user to interact with the <a href="#operating-system">operating system</a>.</p>

<h4 id="shell-script">shell script</h4>
<p>:   A set of <a href="#shell">shell</a> commands stored in a file for re-use.
    A shell script is a program executed by the shell;
    the name “script” is used for historical reasons.</p>

<h4 id="standard-input">standard input</h4>
<p>:   A process’s default input stream.
    In interactive command-line applications,
    it is typically connected to the keyboard;
    in a <a href="#pipe">pipe</a>,
    it receives data from the <a href="#standard-output">standard output</a> of the preceding process.</p>

<h4 id="standard-output">standard output</h4>
<p>:   A process’s default output stream.
    In interactive command-line applications,
    data sent to standard output is displayed on the screen;
    in a <a href="#pipe">pipe</a>,
    it is passed to the <a href="#standard-input">standard input</a> of the next process.</p>

<h4 id="sub-directory">sub-directory</h4>
<p>:   A directory contained within another directory.</p>

<h4 id="tab-completion">tab completion</h4>
<p>:   A feature provided by many interactive systems in which
    pressing the Tab key triggers automatic completion of the current word or command.</p>

<h4 id="variable">variable</h4>
<p>:   A name in a program that is associated with a value or a collection of values.</p>

<h4 id="while-loop">while loop</h4>
<p>:   A loop that keeps executing as long as some condition is true.
    See also: <a href="#for-loop">for loop</a>.</p>

<h4 id="wildcard">wildcard</h4>
<p>:   A character used in pattern matching.
    In the Unix shell,
    the wildcard <code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code> matches zero or more characters,
    so that <code class="highlighter-rouge">*.txt</code> matches all files whose names end in <code class="highlighter-rouge">.txt</code>.</p>
